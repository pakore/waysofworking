# A guide to Paco's Ways of Working

## Introduction

Over the years, I have worked in different companies and I've seen many ways to develop software and projects. I've always tried to keep the ways that were making me and my team more sucessful, and discarded the ones that for one reason or another, didn't work that well. 
In this guide, you will find a summarized set of ways of working that I have learnt over the last 15 years. Keep in mind that this is based on my personal experience, so in your particular case or organization, some of them may not make sense.

# This is the way

#### Be your most demanding customer

If facing with a design decision, ask yourself: "_What would the customer prefer?_"
In the real world a customer usually is an external human being that decides to pay for your services. But in the IT world, a customer can be **anyone** that is consuming what you produce. A customer could be:
- A person that does not belong to the organization
- Another team within your organization
- A teammate
- Your line manager
- Your future self

Keeping a customer happy is probably the most difficult task when developing software. So if you have the chance to make things easier for your customer, usually is the right way to go. For example, I had to create a new service with a new API. I asked myself: "_If I were a customer and I would be deciding if this API was useful for my team, what would help me decide_". I answered myself:
- Superb documentation
- OpenAPI description
- Interactive examples
- Some kind of playground
- An intuitive API

And suddenly I had a list of items to work on that would make the customer happy. I was proud of the quality of my work, which made me happy too. Customers could find what they were looking for right away, so I did not have to invest much time answering questions, which allowed me to focus on the next iterations.

In a nutshell: Imagine what your customer would want and your life will be easier.
